I have plans of creating a benchmark framework for MoKa Reads that will help compare different metrics of programming languages against each other. Here are some of the metrics we'd leak to observe:

1. Compilation time: How long it takes to compile a program
    
2. Execution speed: How long it takes for a program to run
    
    * Can be tested for different optimization modes along with different flags
        
3. Binary size: How big are the outputted binary is
    
4. Memory usage: How efficiently the language uses memory
    

What sort of programs can help test these metrics?

* Recursion using fibonacci sequence
    
* Hello world
    
* JSON parsing
    
* Matrix operations with generics
    
* Matrix operations with floats
    
* Huge Dynamic array
    
    * Test pushing, searching, and sorting
        
* Huge HashMap
    
    * Test inserting, get, remove, updating
        
* Calculating Pi to 1,000,000th digit using Chudnovsky algorithm
    
* RK4 algorithm to approximate IVPs
    
* Secant method to estimate roots in a function
    
* Stochastic simulation algorithm to model chemical reactions
    
    * Requires random numbers
        

### Languages

Here is a list of languages we hope to include into our benchmark suite:

* C (all)
    
* C++ (all)
    
* Zig (all)
    
* Rust (all)
    
* Swift (2-4)
    
* Go (all)
    
* Java (2-4)
    
* Python (2-4)
    

### Organization

We hope to organize in the following manner:

```bash
suite/ 
    bencher.something
    suite.json
    outputs.txt 
    # for example huge dynamic array...
    huge_dyn_array/
        zig/
            huge_dyn_arr_gpa.zig # uses general purpose allocator
            huge_dyn_arr_page.zig # uses page allocator 
            huge_dyn_arr_c.zig # uses malloc 
        c/
            huge_dyn_arr.c 
        rust/ 
            huge_dyn_arr.rs 
        ...
```

We hope in `suite.json` to be able to define parameters such as how many samples, warm up time, flags for different languages, etc.
