Zig Unleashed has been in production since June 2023 and will be my 7th publication (or second programming one), and will be releasing sometime in 2024. While there is still work to do, it is at a good position where I am able to reveal the TOC of the book...well first depth of it.

The goal of this book is to be the **goto guide** of the Zig Programming Language to learn the basics =&gt; advanced parts of it. We go pretty low-level in the book, look through some of the standard library implementations of structures, and get our hands dirty.

## Table of Contents:

**Chapter 1:** Introduction

**Chapter 2:** The Basics

**Chapter 3:** Functions

**Chapter 4:** Arrays and Slices

**Chapter 5:** Struct, Enums and Unions

**Chapter 6:** Pointers and Memory Management

**Chapter 7:** Error Handling

**Chapter 8:** Interfacing with C

**Chapter 9:** Advance Topics

Stay Tuned for more news about Zig Unleashed as we hope to release it this year as our first publication fro myself, Mustafif Khan and MoKa Reads.
