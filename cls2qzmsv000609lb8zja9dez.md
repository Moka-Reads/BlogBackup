It is time to talk about the research paper initiatives we would like to produce/explore.

To help fund this research, consider sponsoring us on **HashNode** or directly on the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mokareads).

These papers will be using the MoKa Template, and will be under our Github soon. If you are interested in helping or want to join our team, consider emailing **help@mokareads.org.**
