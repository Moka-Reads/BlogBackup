I have spent the last few days working on redesigning the websites for MoKa Reads and Mufi-Lang, firstly they both compile down to static assets and run on GitHub pages; this helps them run fast and avoid the annoying rundown time when hosting from a provider in a free instance.

## New MoKa Reads Website

[mokareads.org](https://mokareads.org) is built under a Zig static site generator called Zine, and works fantastically well and is a fork of the Zine website. It does the job well, and the website runs fast and works using SuperHTML and SuperMD.

## New Mufi-Lang Website

Wait…isn’t there mufiz.mustafif.com??? Well yes but a pain to update, so I decided to use the Javascript framework Astro (which thankfully has me avoid using any JS) with the Starlight Ion Theme to develop our MufiZ documentation site, and will be hosted at [mufi-lang.mokareads.org](https://mufi-lang.mokareads.org).
