On Feb 12th I chose not to renew my domain for `mkproj.com`, as I have been in the process of depreciating my portfolio organization in favor of focusing on MoKa Reads, and no longer being able to maintain many of the projects in it, I also chose to transfer TexCreate to MoKa Reads. It made sense at the time, as TexCreate was part of my workflow of creating documents, and I had planned on making version 4, that was the plan. However, I no longer use TexCreate, I really don’t, I have been using `typst` it in the last year as I found it to be the documenting language I always wished for, and wished TexCreate to be, but also that I don’t need to continue further, nor do I have the time if I really forced myself to, but I don’t want to force myself.

TexCreate was a simple idea, a project creator that built projects using prebuilt templates. It made my life so much easier for a few years and most importantly made me so much more comfortable with Rust and learn so many new things. It’s a project that will always have a special place in my heart, my first big project, but it’s been a year since the last release, and I no longer have any plans to continue to maintain it.

A year ago when I looked at the total downloads of the project it was at 12K, since then it has gone up to 40K downloads and I really have to appreciate that people continue to use the project and I thank everyone who does. The project is open-source, and anyone can continue this project (hopefully can understand some of my jank).
